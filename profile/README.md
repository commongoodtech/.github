# Common Good Technologies

A Public Benefit Corporation building revolutionary open-source tools that democratize access to systems traditionally controlled by gatekeepers and wealth. We operate through a radically different organizational model that proves ethical business practices and commercial success are not just compatible, but mutually reinforcing.

## Current Projects

### [TaxRobin](https://github.com/commongoodtech/taxrobin)
Democratizing tax knowledge and strategies previously available only to the wealthy through an AI-powered, open-source tax platform that evolves alongside the tax code.

## Organization Structure

This repository serves as the central hub for Common Good Technologies' development efforts. We use GitHub Projects to organize our work across different initiatives.

### Key Principles

1. **Knowledge Liberation**: Freeing specialized knowledge from artificial barriers
2. **Radical Transparency**: Operating with complete openness
3. **Equitable Organization**: Practicing equity through flat structures
4. **Technology Democracy**: Building technology that redistributes power
5. **Systemic Revolution**: Targeting systems, not symptoms
